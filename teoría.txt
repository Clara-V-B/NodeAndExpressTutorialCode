npm, node package manager unables us to do three things:
- reuse our own code in other projects
- use code written by other developers
- share our own solutions with other developers

npm calls the reusable code a package
a package essentially is a folder that contains a javascript code
another names that I will hear are modules and dependencies
the three names are used interchangeably

there is no quality control in npm registry, so anyone can publish anything
a good indication of the security and usefulness of package is the amount of weekly download, if the number is high

como instal√© node, tengo instalado npm, que me da acceso a npm global command
check the version of node with:
node --version
or
node -v

local dependency - use it only in this particular project
npm i <packageName>

global dependecy - use it in any project
npm install -g <packageName>
sudo npm install -g <packageName> (mac)

con npx ya no es necesario usar tanto las dependencias globales

package.json - manifest file (stores important info about project/package)
manual approach (create package.json in the root, create properties, etc.)
npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
npm init -y (everything default)
